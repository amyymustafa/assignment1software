1-Class is a user defined type or data structure that has data and functions 
2-Class can contain private, protected and public members  . The private members are not accessible outside the class , they can be accessed only through functions of the class. The public members form an interface to the class and are accessible outside the class .. so as long as abstraction's definition is providing only essential information to the outside world and hiding their background details , classes are perfectly into abstraction and data hiding  
3-Object is an instance of a class , a class defines the behavior of possibly many instances , objects are used to make it clear which class we are using 
4-
6-Constructors are executed once an object of class is created , and they are used to assign initial values for certain variables  , Destructors are executed the same as constructors but they are used to  release resources before coming out of the program like closing files, releasing memories
8- default constructor is a constructor that is automatically generated by the compiler in the absence of any programmer-defined constructors
